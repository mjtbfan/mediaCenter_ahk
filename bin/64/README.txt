This folder includes AutoHotkeyU64.exe (v1) copied a bunch of times
- This is not the best way to do this, which is why this is a beta
- The reason why it is copied a bunch of times is an easy way to tell if something is running is to
  check ProcessExist(), which works if my many copies of the ahk exe are named differently
