# Media Center (Beta)

This repo is for the beta version of my "Media Center" project. This project is designed to make a Windows 10 computer usable as a "video game console" (strictly interfacable with a gamepad) through the use of specific programs (LaunchBox, Kodi, JoyToKey) and the custom scripts & config files in this repo.

This is a beta version using AutoHotKey v~1.1. I plan to redo the codebase using AutoHotKey_H v2 for features such as dynamic imports, dynamic code execution, and multithreading. That version will be on my GitHub when it supports all of the functionality of this repo.
